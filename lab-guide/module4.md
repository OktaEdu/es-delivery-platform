## Lab 4-1: Configure a Custom Domain

🎯 **Objective:**   Configure a custom domain in Okta and configure your DNS to support the custom URL. 

🎬 **Scenario**    Continuing with the white label experience, Okta Ice wants to change the Okta URL to its own domain. In this lab, you will configure Okta and your DNS to change the Okta URL end-users will use. 

⏱️ **Duration:**     20 minutes

---

📝 **Note** In this lab, make sure to use the general Okta account in the DNS, NOT your individual account, or you will not be able to verify.

### Configure a Custom Domain

1.  Log in to your Okta org as `oktatraining`.

2.  Click `Customizations` > `Domain`.

3.  Click `Edit` and then click the `Get started` button.

4.  To locate the fully qualified domain name assigned to you for this class:

    a.  Open the credentials spreadsheet

    b.  Navigate to the `CLOUDFLARE` section

    c.  Locate the `SUBDOMAIN` and `DOMAIN` next to your name in the list

    d.  Your fully qualified domain is `<SUBDOMAIN>.<DOMAIN>`, e.g. `signin###.coffee-ice.com`.

5.  Enter your fully qualified domain name into the `Domain` field in Okta.

6.  Under **Certificate management**, ensure Okta-managed is selected.

7.  Click `Next`.

8.  Okta will now provide you with a `TXT` value and a `CNAME` value.

    a.  The `TXT` value is a `DNS 01` challenge, which is used to prove that you own this domain name. We will enter this `TXT` record in our DNS host so Okta can verify our ownership.

    b.  The `CNAME` value allows us to use our domain as an alias to our Okta org. We will also need to enter this `CNAME` record in our DNS host.

### Configure DNS Host

1.  In a new tab, navigate to the DNS configuration tool at https://oktaice.store/ciam/

2.  Login to the DNS configuration tool:

    a.  Enter your assigned **subdomain** (e.g., signin###)

    b.  Select your assigned **domain** from the drop-down menu

    c.  Enter `oktatraining` for the **username**

    d.  Enter `Tra!nme4321` for the **password**

    e.  Click `Login`

3.  You should see a screen like the one below. Verify that you have logged in to modify the DNS entries for the correct subdomain and domain.

 <img src="img/4-1-ciam-tool.png" width=" 600px">

4.  When you first log in, there should not be any entries. If there are, delete them.

5.  First, add the `TXT` entry:

    a.  Click `Add Entry`

    b.  In the `Type` section, choose `TXT`

    c.  Switch back to your Okta tab

    d.  Copy the **TXT entry name** (e.g.,`_acme-challenge.signin###.coffee-ice.com`)

    e.  Switch back to the DNS configuration tool

    f.  Paste this text into the `Name` field

    g.  Switch back to your Okta tab

    h.  Copy the **TXT entry content** (a unique value generated by Okta)

    i.  Switch back to the DNS configuration tool

    j.  Paste this text into the `Content` field

    k.  Click `Add`

6.  Now add the CNAME entry:

    a.  In the `Type` section, choose `CNAME`

    b.  Switch back to your Okta tab

    c.  Copy the **CNAME entry name** (e.g., `signin###.coffee-ice.com`)

    d.  Switch back to the DNS configuration tool

    e.  Paste this text into the `Name` field

    f.  Switch back to your Okta tab

    g.  Copy the **TXT entry content** (Your Okta org URL)

    h.  Switch back to the DNS configuration tool

    i.  Paste this text into the `Content` field

    j.  Click `Add`

7.  Verify the entries were added to the DNS configuration.

    a.  Click `Cancel`

    b.  You should now see the two entries you added

8.  You can now log out of the DNS configuration tool and close the tab

### Issue the Okta-Managed Certificate

1.  Navigate back to the Okta tab and click `Next`

2.  Okta will take a moment to verify the DNS 01 challenge

    a.  If verification fails, go back and check that you entered both the TXT and CNAME records correctly

    b.  If verification is successful, Okta will issue a TLS certificate for your custom domain. Click `Finish`.

### ✅ Checkpoint

At this point, you have done the configuration that will allow you to access your Okta org with your custom domain. It can take a few minutes for DNS to update, so we will verify that it works in a subsequent lab.

## Lab 4-2: Implement a Password Policy

🎯 **Objective:**   Create a password policy for Retailer accounts. Generate a temporary password for Kay West. Test password reset.
