## The Company

Okta Ice has been in the ice cream business for 15 years. In the first
year, they only had two stores, but have grown to 30 stores across
California. Between the 30 stores there are approximately 800 workers
and a recent acquisition of an ice cream truck business means additional
head count. While the operators of the ice cream trucks are independent
contractors, they are remote and require mobile access to various
company applications. Eventually, they also want to expand to the
Eastern US and into the gelato market in Europe.

## Challenges

-   Retailers, suppliers, and distributors need a portal to manage
    orders and contact Okta Ice for help.

-   Eventually these partners will also need a self-registration.

-   Customers currently carry paper cards for the rewards program, but
    this should be moved to an online interaction.
